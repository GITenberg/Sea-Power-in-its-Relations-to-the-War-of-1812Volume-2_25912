description: Courage, loyalty, and service to the state are among the virtues extolled
  here by Mahan, the father of modern sea power theory. This authoritative 1905 history
  is based on his lectures as president of the Naval War College. Volume Two takes
  the story from the winter of 1812/3 and Bainbridge's Squadron to the peace negotiations
  which ended the war in February of 1815.
